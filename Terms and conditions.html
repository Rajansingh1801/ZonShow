                        <p>We provide some of the picParc Services to you free of charge, while other picParc Services
                            require you to sign up for a subscription and pay a subscription fee and applicable taxes
                            (the
                            “picParc Subscription Services”). Unless otherwise stated on your sign-up page, if you sign
                            up
                            for a subscription, you agree that your subscription may be automatically renewed (subject
                            to
                            applicable law) for another subscription period of equal length (for example, monthly or
                            annually) and at the then-current price for such subscription. You acknowledge that billing
                            may
                            not occur on the same date of each month, depending on when you signed up for the picParc
                            Services. By way of example, if you sign up for a monthly subscription on July 31, you will
                            be
                            billed on/near August 31, September 30, etc.). We reserve the right to change the terms of
                            your
                            subscription, including price, from time to time. We will attempt to give you advance notice
                            of
                            any such price changes prior to the next billing cycle, but we will not be able to notify
                            you of
                            any
                            changes in applicable taxes. If you do not wish to accept a price change, you may cancel
                            your
                            subscription in accordance with these Terms.</p>

                <p>At picParc, we don’t make promises we can’t keep. So, please see below for the fresh dog food
                    recipe inspired by Sam Backmann-Fired legendary dish, which he so memorably brought to Jail.
                    This is for a 30 pound dog a week's supply in 8 oz cups, or 2-15 lb dogs in 4 oz cups.</p>
                <p>Ingredients:</p>
                <p>In a large pot Pre Cook, 3 cups of rice, using 6 cups of water. First bring water to boil then add
                    rice, boil for 5 minutes and then turn the heat to low for 40 minutes. Let it cool. <br>
                    In a 6 Quart Crock Pot or kettle cook at high heat for 6.5 hour</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>6 large carrots cut in 2” lengths
                    </li>
                    <li>1 large sweet potato cut in pieces</li>
                    <li>2 large heads of Broccoli cut in pieces</li>
                    <li>1 Cauliflower cut in pieces
                    </li>
                    <li>3 Chicken breasts cut in pieces</li>
                    <li>2 15-16 oz cans of beans, your choice.</li>
                    <li>Water, fill to the top, usually 2 quarts.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>After cooking remove the large pisces with a straining spoon and place in a blender.
                    Place the Blended food and mix in the rice in a large bowl.
                </p>
                <p>Strain the rest of the food in the Crockpot and blend these small pieces. Add them to the mix.</p>
                <p>Stir the mix so that the rice blends nicely with the Food in the bowl .</p>
                <p>Dish out the mixture into 8 oz or 4 oz containers, Zip lock has a nice selection and is very
                    inexpensive. Place in the freezer and leave a day's supply in the Ice box.</p>

                <p><strong>Binding Arbitration Of All Non-Small Claims Disputes. Class Action Waiver.</strong></p>
                <p>If you have a Dispute (as defined below) with us that cannot be resolved informally or in small
                    claims court, you will not have the right to pursue a claim in court or have a jury decide the
                    claim, and you will not have the right to bring or participate in any class action or similar
                    proceeding in court or in arbitration. By using or interacting with the NBCUniversal Services, or
                    engaging in any other NBCUniversal Transactions or Relationships with us, you agree as
                    follows:</p>
                <p>“Dispute” means any complaint, dispute, or disagreement you may have against us, and any
                    claim that we may have against you, whether based on past, present, or future events, arising
                    out of or related in any way to these TOS or regarding (i) your use of or interaction with the
                    NBCUniversal Services, (ii) any purchases or other transactions or relationships related to your
                    use of the NBCUniversal Services, or (iii) any data or information you provide to us or we gather
                    in connection with such use, interaction or transaction (collectively, "NBCUniversal Transactions
                    or Relationships").</p>
                <p>Many Disputes can be resolved by an informal dialogue with our customer service staff. If you
                    have a Dispute with us, before initiating an arbitration, you must send an individualized, written
                    notice describing the Dispute to the customer support contact via email or contact form
                    associated with the NBCUniversal Service to which your Dispute relates. Without limiting any of
                    our rights in Sections 3, 5, 7, before we initiate any arbitration, we will send you a written
                    notice
                    using contact information we have for you. Promptly following receipt of such notice, you and we
                    will try to resolve the Dispute by individual telephone or videoconference, or in person if you and
                    we agree. If the Dispute is not resolved within 14 days of starting this dialogue, then either you
                    or we may initiate an action in a small claims court that has jurisdiction over the Dispute and is
                    reasonably close to your place of residence or work, or initiate an arbitration as described below
                    if the Dispute is ineligible to be adjudicated in small claims court.</p>
                <p>Any Dispute that we are unable to resolve through the informal procedure described above and
                    is ineligible for small claims court shall be resolved exclusively by final, binding arbitration
                    ("Arbitration"). The Arbitrator may issue orders to protect the confidentiality of proprietary
                    information, trade secrets or other sensitive information. Except as discussed below in clause a,
                    the Arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator administered by JAMS or its
                    successor ("JAMS") and conducted in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules
                    And Procedures (or, if the amount in controversy exceeds $250,000, the JAMS Comprehensive
                    Arbitration Rules And Procedures) in effect at the time the Arbitration is initiated (respectively,
                    the "Applicable Rules"). The Applicable Rules can be found at www.jamsadr.com. This Section
                    18 shall not prevent any party from seeking provisional remedies (that is, a temporary
                    restraining order or preliminary injunction) from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.</p>
